# About me
Hi there! My name is Xiaoxuan Li (Shawn), I earned my PhD degree from George Mason University majoring in Earth Systems and Geoinformation Sciences, where I conduct multidisciplinary research on calibration and validation of spaceborne LiDAR datasets (GEDI and ICESat-2) and the fusion of coincident airborne LiDAR, GEDI, and SAR (ALOS-1 PALSAR and ALOS-1 PALSAR-2) to produce aboveground biomass maps. I collaborate with NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) and the University of Maryland on interdisciplinary projects that use remote sensing data and methods to study vegetation structure and biomass.

I also hold my master’s degree in Geospatial Information Sciences and my bachelor’s in surveying & mapping engineering (photogrammetry and remote sensing). I have extensive experience and skills in geospatial analysis software (proficient in ArcGIS Pro), programming languages (proficient in Python and R), remote sensing data processing and analytics, predictive analytics, machine learning, and web-based GIS technologies. I have applied these skills to various topics, such as vegetation change monitoring, multi-source data fusion, natural hazards mapping and risk assessment, and forest biomass estimation. I am passionate about using remote sensing and data science to address environmental and societal challenges, and I am always eager to learn new remote sensing & data science techniques and tools.
